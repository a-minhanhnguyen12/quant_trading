# quant_trading
This repository contains my work in quantitative trading using Python. It includes backtesting strategies with real market data, analyzing sector and price trends, and building predictive models with libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. Each project is built on practical applications and personal research in stock analysis.
